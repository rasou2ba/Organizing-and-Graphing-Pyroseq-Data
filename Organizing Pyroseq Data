#Tidy Pyroseq Result Report - Updated 6/2/18

#Need tidyr and dplyr package to organize this data into an easy to use dataset
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

#Before importing data, change the following using exce:
##add a "Distance from TSS" column next to each Position column 
##Change teh "Meth. (%)" column name to "MethPercent"

#import the data: the check.names changes the naming of columns that have the same name. Ex there are 4 "MethPercent" columns that are each renamed
data <- read.csv("LRIT1data.csv", header=T, skip = 2, check.names = T)

#look at the beginning of the data
head(data)

#The assay column has lots of info. We will seperate the infor and only keep what we need (gene name). Ignore the warning message of "Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 24 rows"
data <- separate(data, Assay, c("Gene.Name", sep="-"))

#keep only the columns of data we need. 
data <- select(data, Gene.Name, Note, 
               Distance.from.TSS, Name, MethPercent, Quality,
               Distance.from.TSS.1, Name.1, MethPercent.1, Quality.1,
               Distance.from.TSS.2, Name.2 ,MethPercent.2, Quality.2, 
               Distance.from.TSS.3, Name.3, MethPercent.3, Quality.3)
###---!!!!!!Will be more if there are more poistions!!!!!!---##

#look at the data
head(data)

#It's possible that you have more than one gene per CSV file. In this case, you need to split the CSV by gene
InsertGeneName1Here <- filter(data, Gene.Name == "InsertGeneName1Here")
InsertGeneName2Here <- filter(data, Gene.Name == "InsertGeneName2Here")
##Repeat for as many genes as you have


#StepA: For the gene sperate the positions into multiple data frames. NOTE that you have to change the first argument (InsertGeneName1Here)
pos1 <- subset(InsertGeneName1Here, select=c("Gene.Name", "Note", "Name", "Distance.from.TSS", "MethPercent", "Quality"))
pos2 <- subset(InsertGeneName1Here, select=c("Gene.Name", "Note", "Name.1", "Distance.from.TSS.1","MethPercent.1", "Quality.1"))
pos3 <- subset(InsertGeneName1Here, select=c("Gene.Name", "Note", "Name.2", "Distance.from.TSS.2","MethPercent.2", "Quality.2"))
pos4 <- subset(InsertGeneName1Here, select=c("Gene.Name", "Note", "Name.3", "Distance.from.TSS.3","MethPercent.3", "Quality.3"))

##---!!!!!!repeat this for as many positions as there are!!!!!!---##

#look at the data
head(pos1)
head(pos2)
head(pos3)
head(pos4)

#Step B: rename the columns for each subset of data you just made
names(pos1) <- c("Gene.Name", "Tissue.Type", "Position", "Distance.from.TSS", "Methylation.Level", "Quality")
names(pos2) <- c("Gene.Name", "Tissue.Type", "Position", "Distance.from.TSS", "Methylation.Level", "Quality")
names(pos3) <- c("Gene.Name", "Tissue.Type", "Position", "Distance.from.TSS", "Methylation.Level", "Quality")
names(pos4) <- c("Gene.Name", "Tissue.Type", "Position", "Distance.from.TSS", "Methylation.Level", "Quality")

#look at the data
head(pos1)
head(pos2)
head(pos3)
head(pos4)

#Step C: remove rows from each dataframe if the Quality is "Failed"
pos1 <- filter(pos1, Quality != "Failed")
pos2 <- filter(pos2, Quality != "Failed")
pos3 <- filter(pos3, Quality != "Failed")
pos4 <- filter(pos4, Quality != "Failed")

#Step D: remove the Quality column (this is optional)
pos1 <- select(pos1, -Quality)
pos2 <- select(pos2, -Quality)
pos3 <- select(pos3, -Quality)
pos4 <- select(pos4, -Quality)

#Step E: combine dataframes into one large dataframe. This is your data for one gene.
MethData1 <- rbind(pos1,pos2,pos3,pos4)
#if you have more postions, you will have more to combine. Ex: rbind(pos1,pos2,pos3,pos4,pos5,pos6)

#REPEAT Steps A through E for each of the genes in the original CpG Analysis Result Report
#You may have multiple files for one gene. You should go through this above process for each file and then combine the dataframes that are for the same gene.
#You want one dataframe for each gene. 
#You can also combine all the gene dataframes to make one master dataframe with all the data for all your genes of interest.

#Save your dataframe to a desired location
write.csv(MethData1,file = file.choose(new = T))
#This will open a window. Choose the save location
#In File Name, write in what you want to call the csv file (Ex: MethData.csv)
#Then click open. You'll be told that this file doesn't exist and if you want to make a new one. Click "Yes". 
#Your csv file should now be saved at your desired location with your desired name.
