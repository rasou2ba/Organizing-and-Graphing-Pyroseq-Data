#-Methylation Percentages as Dot Graph-# Updated 6/2/18

#Directions: You need to change: Step1 - the name of the CSV file
                                #Step 2 - the name of the gene (in place of SYDE2)
                                #Step 4.5 - the levels depending on the tissue your working with (in place of "Cornea", "Macula" , etc)
                                #Step 5.1 - the title of the plot (in place of SYDE2)
                                #Step 5.2 - the breaks depending on the tissue your working with (in place of "Cornea","Macula","Peripheral Retina")

#STEP 1) Read the data:
data <- read.csv(header = T, "humanmethyl.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM")

#to pull out the list of genes that are in the data frame:
unique(data$Gene.Name,incomparables = FALSE)

#STEP 2) Seperate out the data/gene of interest.
library(dplyr)
#Filter data by: filter(data,Gene.Name == "Insert Gene Name Here") #single or double quotes works.
#You do not need to do this if your csv file contains data for only one gene. 
#rename the filtered data: 
gene <- filter(data,Gene.Name == "SYDE2") #single or double quotes work and alwasy call this "gene" but change Gene.Name == 

#Make sure the correct data has been filtered out:
gene

#STEP 3) Get mean and standard deviation

#Run the functions mean and sd on the value of "Methylation.Level" for each group broken down by Tissue.Type, Position, and Distance.from.TSS

data2 <- summarize(group_by(gene, Tissue.Type),
                   MeanMethylation.Level = mean(Methylation.Level,na.rm=TRUE),
                   sd = sd(Methylation.Level,na.rm=TRUE))

#Look at the data output:
data2

#STEP 4) Convert those variables to factors:
Position <- as.factor(data2$Position)
Tissue <- as.factor(data2$Tissue.Type)
Distance <- as.factor(data2$Distance.from.TSS)

#to see part of the modified data. Notice that the methylation level is now the mean and a new column (sd for standard deviation) is added
head(data2)

#STEP 4.5) set tissue levels as factors so that the can be ordered correclty in the legend. 
Tissue <- factor(data2$Tissue.Type, levels=c("Cornea","Macula","Peripheral Retina"))

#Start up the library:
library(ggplot2)

#STEP 5) Make the point Graph

point <- ggplot(data2, aes(x = Tissue, y = MeanMethylation.Level, color=Tissue, group = Tissue, show.legend = TRUE)) 
#add the point and error bars with some aesthetic changes
point <- point + geom_point(size = 2.5, show.legend = FALSE) +  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=MeanMethylation.Level-sd, ymax = MeanMethylation.Level+sd), width=0.1, size=1)

#STEP 5.1) Finish point plot aesthetic
point <- point +labs(title="SYDE2", x="Tissue Type", y = "Avg Methylation Percentage (%)") + theme_classic() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 35)) + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20)) + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 15), axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))
#choosing colors (will need to change the values depending on tissue type)
#point <- point + line <- line + scale_color_manual(values=c("Cornea" = "grey", "Macula" = "orange","Peripheral Retina" = "brown3"))
#change legend aethetics
point <- point + theme(legend.text=element_text(size=15)) + theme(legend.title = element_blank())
#to make the y-axis show 0-100%:
point <- point + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100))

#STEP 5.2) to make the legend icons larger.
point <- point + guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=2)), breaks=c("Cornea","Macula","Peripheral Retina"))
#call teh plot
point
